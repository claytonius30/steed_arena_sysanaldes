# Steed Arena Systems Analysis and Design

My contribution to a system analysis and design group project on Steed Arena.

Challenge: Perform a Systems Anaylsis & Design for a local business/organization in Helena, MT.

Context: For the final project in my Systems Analysis & Design class, I was tasked along with my group to find a local business and either identify a need or come up with a hypothetical problem/solution to perform a business analysis. Before selecting an actual business, we had weekly assignments where we came up with a mock ticketing system based on email that needed to be upgraded to a modern Software as a Service solution. We would go on to use this hypothetical situation in the report along with the actual business need we identified.

Action: As a group, we decided on the Steed Arena, home of the Helena Bighorns, for our business. Upon meeting with the arena owner, Jed Snyder, we learned that they were indeed not in need of a new ticketing system so we focused their more pressing issue of improving their mechanical operations equipment. By the time we had the chance to meet with Jed, we were well into the later part of the semester and consulted with our instructor to allow us to focus both on the hypothetical issue as well as the actual one.

Result: By the end of the semester, we successfully completed our our project and gave a presentation to our class. My contribution to the project was the hypothetical ticketing system as well as proposing additional alternatives to the actual mechanical issue needs, i.e. dehumidification. 

Reflection: Working with a group for this project, we all contributed in our own way. I made contact with the owner and set up the meeting times for information gathering and reporting. I learned the importance of good communication with my group and clearly outlining each of our roles in completing the project.
